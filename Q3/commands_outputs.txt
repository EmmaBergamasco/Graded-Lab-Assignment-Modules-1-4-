1. File Creation 
echo "This is some sample text for testing links." > sample_data.txt
//created a file sample_data.txt in my home directory containing sample text using "echo"
cat sample_data.txt
//verified content using "cat"

2. Hard Link Creation 
ln sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt
//created a hard link of sample_data.txt called sample_hard.txt so both files share the same data using "ln"

3. Symbolic Link Creation 
ln -s sample_data.txt sample_soft.txt
//created a symbolic link sample_soft.txt that points to sample_data.txt using "ln -s"; this is a separate inode and is just a reference to the original file

4. Inode Verification
ls -i sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt
Output: 230161 sample_data.txt 230161 sample_hard.txt 230803 sample_soft.txt
//listed inode numbers to see which files share the same inode using "ls -i"; this helps differentiate hard and soft links

5. Inode Analysis
sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode because a hard link points directly to the same data on disk; sample_soft.txt has a different inode because symbolic links are separate files that reference the original

6. File Metadata Inspection
ls -l sample_data.txt
Output: -rw-r--r-- 2 coder coder 43 Dec 30 21:02 sample_data.txt
//displayed detailed metadata (permissions, owner, size, timestamps) of sample_data.txt using "ls -l"

7. Disk Usage Check
du -h | tail -n 10
Output:
87K   ./noVNC/vendor/pako/lib
90K   ./noVNC/vendor/pako
7.0K  ./noVNC/vendor/browser-es-module-loader/src
553K  ./noVNC/vendor/browser-es-module-loader/dist
564K  ./noVNC/vendor/browser-es-module-loader
1.7M  ./noVNC/vendor
3.1M  ./noVNC
13K   ./Desktop.save
14K   ./install
9.7M  .
//displayed disk usage "du" of the home directory in a human-readable "-h" format to see space consumed by files and directories (shows only the last 10 lines of the output usign "tail -n 10" to make it easier to read)
  
8. File Size Overview
ls -lh 
(check output in screenshot) 
//listed all files in the home directory with human-readable "-lh" sizes to check each file size
  
9. Link Deletion Test
rm sample_soft.txt
//deleted the symbolic link sample_soft.txt using "rm"
ls -l sample_data.txt
Output: -rw-r--r-- 2 coder coder 43 Dec 30 21:02 sample_data.txt
//verified that the original file sample_data.txt is unaffected (because soft links are separate files)

10. Disk Utility Demonstration
du -sh 
Output: 9.7M
//showed total disk space "du" used by the home directory in human-readable format "-sh"
df -h
(check output in screenshot) 
//showed available and used space on all mounted filesystems in a readable format; unlike du, which measures the space used by specific directories/files, df gives an overall view of storage usage per partition
Docker storage shows actual disk usage for workspace
Use% indicates how full each filesystem is, helping monitor storage health
"tmpfs" are mostly free
