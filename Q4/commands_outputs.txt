1. System Uptime Verification
uptime
Output: 11:47:21 up 27 days, 19:46, 0 users, load average: 5.50, 5.59, 5.58
//displayed how long the system has been running, the number of users logged in, and the load average using "uptime"

2. User Process Listing
ps -u $USER 
(check screenshots for output) 
//listed all processes currently running "ps" under my user account "$USER" to monitor active programs

3. CPU Usage Analysis
ps -u $USER -o pid,cmd,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head -n 2
Output: 
PID CMD                         %CPU
38  /usr/bin/Xvnc :1 -auth /hom 0.2
//listed my running processes "ps" sorted by CPU usage and displays the process currently consuming the highest CPU resources using:
"-o" to specify the output format
"pid" to speficy process ID
"%cpu" to specify CPU usage percentage of the process
"--sort=-%cpu" to sort processes by CPU usage
"-n 2" used to display the header line and the top CPU-consuming process after sorting

4. Background Process Execution  
sleep 60 &
Output: [1] 274
//started a sleep 60 command in the background 
jobs
Output: [1]+  Running                 sleep 60 &  
//verified background command is running using "jobs"

5. Process Priority Management
renice +5 -p 274
Output: 274 (process ID): old priority 0, new priority 5  
//changed the niceness (priority) of process 274 from priority 0 to priority 5

6. Memory Usage Monitoring
free -h
Output: 
         total    used    free    shared   buff/cache   available
Mem :    249G     98G     14G     212M     136G         148G
Swap:    8.0G     7.9M    8.0G
//displayed memory usage in a human-readable format "-h" to monitor total, used, free, and swap memory

7. Disk Space Inspection
df -h 
(check screenshot for output) 
//checked the disk space usage of the filesystem containing the home directory to monitor available and used storage

8. Shell Identification
echo $SHELL
Output: coder
//displayed the name of the currently used shell to confirm the command-line environment using "echo"

9. Output Redirection
uname -a > system_report.txt
//redirected system information into system_report.txt to save a snapshot of the system state for later reference
cat system_report.txt
Output: Linux 68cca316b46c 6.5.0-1024-aws #24~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 18 10:43:12 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux  
//verified output redirection  

10. Disk Usage Visualization
ncdu 
Output: bash: ncdu: command not found
//ncdu command was attempted to visualize disk usage interactively in the home directory, allowing navigation through directories and identifying space-consuming files, but it is not available in this restricted environment (Coursera Lab Terminal Emulator); therefore, disk usage was analyzed using du to measure directory sizes (last 10 lines) and df to inspect filesystem-level disk usage
