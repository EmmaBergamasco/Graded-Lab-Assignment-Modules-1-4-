1. Project Workspace Setup
mkdir documents
//created a directory named documents inside my home directory using "mkdir"

2. File Creation
cd documents
touch plan.txt
//navigated into the documents directory using "cd" and created an empty file named plan.txt using "touch"

3. Content Addition
echo "This file contains notes for Command Line Interfaces project" > plan.txt
cat plan.txt
Output: This file contains notes for Command Line Interfaces project
//added sample text into plan.txt using "echo" and verified the content using "cat" 

4. File Metadata Verification
ls -l plan.txt
Output: -rw-r -- r -- 1 coder coder 61 Dec 30 20:25 plan.txt
//displayed file permissions and ownership details, confirming that my username (coder) owns the file using "ls -l"

5. File Duplication
cp plan.txt plan_copy.txt
//created a duplicate of plan.txt named plan_copy.txt using "cp"

6. Directory Renaming
cd 
//back to home directory using "cd" (cannot rename directory when inside it)
mv documents project_documents
//renamed the documents directory to project_documents using "mv" to better reflect the project scope

7. Archival Structure
mkdir project_documents/archive
//created a subdirectory named archive inside project_documents for storing backup files using "mkdir"

8. File Organization
mv project_documents/plan_copy.txt project_documents/archive/
//moved plan_copy.txt into the archive subdirectory to organize project files using "mv"

9. Recursive Listing
ls -R project_documents

Output:
project_documents:
archive plan.txt

project_documents/archive:
plan_copy.txt
//listed all files and subdirectories recursively to display the complete directory structure using "ls -R"

10. Path Verification
realpath project_documents/archive/plan_copy.txt
Output: /home/coder/project_documents/archive/plan_copy.txt
//displayed path of plan_copy.txt after it was moved into the archive directory using "realpath"
